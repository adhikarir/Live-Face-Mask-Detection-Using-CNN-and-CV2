# Live Face Mask Detection Using CNN and CV2
- The corona virus Outbreak has created various changes in the lifestyle of everyone around the world. 
- In those changes wearing a mask has been very vital to every individual and same has been announced by government and WHO. 
- Detection of people who are not wearing masks is a challenge due to the large number of populations. 
- This project can be used in schools, hospitals, banks, airports etc as a digitalized scanning tool. 

## Library Used In this project as
- numpy
- keras
- sklearn
- cv2
- Convolutional Neural Network is used to train the model.
